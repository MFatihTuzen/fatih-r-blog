I believe that it is possible to learn in every moment of life and that success comes from constant work. That's why I always think it's valuable to learn something new and share what I've learned.

I think the R programming language is like a full-fledged toolbox for anyone who deals with data. I will try to present the contents of this toolbox as much as I know and as much as I can.\n\n\n**19 May University, Samsun, Türkiye,** *Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics*, 2000 - 2004\n\n**Kafkas University, Kars, Türkiye,** *Master of Science (M.S.) in Business*, 2010 - 2012\n\n**Gazi University, Ankara,** **Türkiye,** *Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Statistics*, 2013 - 2018\n\n### Experience\n\n**Turkish Statistical Institution, Samsun, Samsun Regional Office,** *Field Interviewer*, Agu 2005 - Dec 2006\n\n**Turkish Statistical Institution, Kars, Kars Regional Office,** *Statistician*, Dec 2006 - Agu 2012\n\n**Social Security Institution, Ankara,** *Statistician*, Agu 2012 - Oct 2015\n\n**Turkish Statistical Institution, Ankara,** *Expert*, Oct 2015- Present\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"flatly","title":"Muhammed Fatih TÜZEN","image":"profile.jpg","about":{"template":"jolla","links":[{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatih-t-2b2a4328/"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/MFatihTuzen"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
