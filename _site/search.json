That’s why I always think it’s valuable to learn something new and share what I’ve learned. I am creating such a blog page to share my knowledge and experience about R and Statistics that I have gained over many years. I think the R programming language is like a full-fledged toolbox for anyone who deals with data. I will try to present the contents of this toolbox as much as I know and as much as I can.\n\nEducation\n19 May University, Samsun, Türkiye, Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics, 2000 - 2004\nKafkas University, Kars, Türkiye, Master of Science (M.S.)
