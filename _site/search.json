    "text": "Welcome to my blog about R and Statistics. I believe that it is possible to learn in every moment of life and that success comes from constant work. That’s why I always think it’s valuable to learn something new and share what I’ve learned. I am creating such a blog page to share my knowledge and experience about R and Statistics that I have gained over many years. I think the R programming language is like a full-fledged toolbox for anyone who deals with data. I will try to present the contents of this toolbox as much as I know and as much as I can.\n\nEducation\n19 May University, Samsun, Türkiye, Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics, 2000 - 2004\nKafkas University, Kars, Türkiye, Master of Science (M.S.)

    "text": "Hello everyone! For my first post on my blog, I would like to make an introduction about R. Before we start coding with R, it’s not a bad idea to know a little about this program and learn what we can do. I will try to answer questions such as why do we need R, how can I install R on my computer, what are the useful resources about R. So, let’s get started."
