In R programming, Apply functions (**`apply()`**, **`sapply()`**, **`lapply()`**) and the **`map()`** function from the purrr package are powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the syntax, usage, and examples of each function, including the usage of built-in functions and additional arguments, as well as performance benchmarking.

## Understanding apply() Function

The `apply()` function in R is used to apply a specified function to the rows or columns of an array. Its syntax is as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)
```

-   **`X`**: The input data, typically an array or matrix.

-   **`MARGIN`**: A numeric vector indicating which margins should be retained. Use **`1`** for rows, **`2`** for columns.

-   **`FUN`**: The function to apply.

-   **`...`**: Additional arguments to be passed to the function.

Let's calculate the mean of each row in a matrix using **`apply()`**:

```{r}
matrix_data <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
row_means <- apply(matrix_data, 1, mean)
print(row_means)

```

This example computes the mean of each row in the matrix.

Let's calculate the standard deviation of each column in a matrix and specify additional arguments (**`na.rm = TRUE`**) using **`apply()`**:

```{r}

column_stdev <- apply(matrix_data, 2, sd, na.rm = TRUE)
print(column_stdev)

```

## Understanding sapply() Function

The **`sapply()`** function is a simplified version of **`lapply()`** that returns a vector or matrix. Its syntax is similar to **`lapply()`**:

```{r}
#| eval: false
sapply(X, FUN, ...)
```

-   **`X`**: The input data, typically a list.

-   **`FUN`**: The function to apply.

-   **`...`**: Additional arguments to be passed to the function.

Let's calculate the sum of each element in a list using **`sapply()`**:

```{r}

num_list <- list(a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9)
sum_results <- sapply(num_list, sum)
print(sum_results)

```

This example computes the sum of each element in the list.

Let's convert each element in a list to uppercase using **`sapply()`** and the **`toupper()`** function:

```{r}
text_list <- list("hello", "world", "R", "programming")
uppercase_text <- sapply(text_list, toupper)
print(uppercase_text)

```

Here, **`sapply()`** applies the **`toupper()`** function to each element in the list, converting them to uppercase.

## Understanding lapply() Function

The **`lapply()`** function applies a function to each element of a list and returns a list. Its syntax is as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
lapply(X, FUN, ...)
```

-   **`X`**: The input data, typically a list.

-   **`FUN`**: The function to apply.

-   **`...`**: Additional arguments to be passed to the function.

Let's apply a custom function to each element of a list using **`lapply()`**:

```{r}

num_list <- list(a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9)
custom_function <- function(x) sum(x) * 2
result_list <- lapply(num_list, custom_function)
print(result_list)

```

In this example, **`lapply()`** applies the custom function to each element in the list.

Let's extract the vowels from each element in a list of words using **`lapply()`** and a custom function:

```{r}
word_list <- list("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape")
vowel_list <- lapply(word_list, function(word) grep("[aeiou]", strsplit(word, "")[[1]], value = TRUE))
print(vowel_list)

```

Here, **`lapply()`** applies the custom function to each element in the list, extracting vowels from words.

## Understanding map() Function

The **`map()`** function from the purrr package is similar to **`lapply()`** but offers a more consistent syntax and returns a list. Its syntax is as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
map(.x, .f, ...)
```

-   **`.x`**: The input data, typically a list.

-   **`.f`**: The function to apply.

-   **`...`**: Additional arguments to be passed to the function.

Let's apply a lambda function to each element of a list using **`map()`**:

```{r}
library(purrr)
num_list <- list(a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9)
mapped_results <- map(num_list, ~ .x^2)
print(mapped_results)

```

In this example, **`map()`** applies the lambda function (squared) to each element in the list.

Let's calculate the lengths of strings in a list using **`map()`** and the **`nchar()`** function:

```{r}

text_list <- list("hello", "world", "R", "programming")
string_lengths <- map(text_list, nchar)
print(string_lengths)

```

Here, **`map()`** applies the **`nchar()`** function to each element in the list, calculating the length of each string.

## Understanding map() Function Variants

In addition to the **`map()`** function, the purrr package provides several variants that are specialized for different types of output: **`map_lgl()`**, **`map_int()`**, **`map_dbl()`**, and **`map_chr()`**. These variants are particularly useful when you expect the output to be of a specific data type, such as logical, integer, double, or character.

-   **`map_lgl()`**: This variant is used when the output of the function is expected to be a logical vector.

-   **`map_int()`**: Use this variant when the output of the function is expected to be an integer vector.

-   **`map_dbl()`**: This variant is used when the output of the function is expected to be a double vector.

-   **`map_chr()`**: Use this variant when the output of the function is expected to be a character vector.

These variants provide stricter type constraints compared to the generic **`map()`** function, which can be useful for ensuring the consistency of the output type across iterations. They are particularly handy when working with functions that have predictable output types.

```{r}
library(purrr)

# Define a list of vectors
num_list <- list(a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9)

# Use map_lgl() to check if all elements in each vector are even
even_check <- map_lgl(num_list, function(x) all(x %% 2 == 0))
print(even_check)

# Use map_int() to compute the sum of each vector
vector_sums <- map_int(num_list, sum)
print(vector_sums)

# Use map_dbl() to compute the mean of each vector
vector_means <- map_dbl(num_list, mean)
print(vector_means)

# Use map_chr() to convert each vector to a character vector
vector_strings <- map_chr(num_list, toString)
print(vector_strings)


```

By using these specialized variants, you can ensure that the output of your mapping operation adheres to your specific data type requirements, leading to cleaner and more predictable code.

## **Performance Comparison**

To compare the performance of these functions, it's important to note that the execution time may vary depending on the hardware specifications of your computer, the size of the dataset, and the complexity of the operations performed. While one function may perform better in one scenario, it may not be the case in another. Therefore, it's recommended to benchmark the functions in your specific use case.

Let's benchmark the computation of the sum of a large list using different functions:

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(microbenchmark)

# Create a 100 x 100 matrix
matrix_data <- matrix(rnorm(10000), nrow = 100)

# Use apply() function to compute the sum for each column
benchmark_results <- microbenchmark(
  apply_sum = apply(matrix_data, 2, sum),
  sapply_sum = sapply(matrix_data, sum),
  lapply_sum = lapply(matrix_data, sum),
  map_sum = map_dbl(as.list(matrix_data), sum),  # We need to convert the matrix to a list for the map function
  times = 100
)

print(benchmark_results)




```

**`apply_sum`** demonstrates the fastest processing time among the alternatives,. These results suggest that while **`apply()`** function offers the fastest processing time, it's still relatively slow compared to other options. When evaluating these results, it's crucial to consider factors beyond processing time, such as usability and functionality, to select the most suitable function for your specific needs.

Overall, the choice of function depends on factors such as speed, ease of use, and compatibility with the data structure. It's essential to benchmark different alternatives in your specific use case to determine the most suitable function for your needs.
