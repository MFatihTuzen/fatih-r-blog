## Introduction

The ability to generate professional Excel reports programmatically is a crucial skill in data analysis and business reporting. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to use the `openxlsx` package in R to create sophisticated Excel reports with multiple sheets, custom formatting, and visualizations. This tutorial is designed for beginners to intermediate R users who want to automate their reporting workflows.

## Why Choose openxlsx?

-   **No Excel Dependency**: Unlike some alternatives, openxlsx doesn't require Excel installation and No Java dependency (unlike XLConnect)

-   **Performance**: Efficient handling of large datasets

-   **Comprehensive Formatting**: Extensive options for cell styling, merging, and formatting

-   **Multiple Worksheets**: Easy management of multiple sheets in a workbook

-   **Custom Styles**: Ability to create and apply custom styles

-   **Memory Efficient**: Better memory management compared to other packages

-   **Active Development**: Regular updates and community support

## Getting Started

First, install and load the required packages:

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Load packages
library(openxlsx)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

## Basic Functions and Their Arguments

### Core Functions

**`createWorkbook()`**

The `createWorkbook()` function is just the starting point and creates a new workbook object. When you run `wb <- createWorkbook()`, you are creating a new, empty workbook object and assigning it to the variable `wb`. This workbook will serve as the container for any worksheets, styles, and data you want to add before saving it as an Excel file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
wb <- createWorkbook()
```

**`addWorksheet()`**

The **`addWorksheet()`** function, part of the **openxlsx** package in R, is used to add a new worksheet (tab) to an Excel workbook created with `createWorkbook()`.

Key arguments:

-   **`wb`**: This is the workbook object to which you're adding a new worksheet. It should be an existing workbook created with `createWorkbook()`.

-   **`sheetName = "Sales Report"`**: This argument specifies the name of the new worksheet. In this case, the sheet will be labeled "Sales Report." The name you choose will appear as the worksheet tab name in the Excel file.

-   **`gridLines = TRUE`**: This argument controls whether gridlines are visible in the worksheet.

    -   **`TRUE`**: Shows gridlines (default setting).

    -   **`FALSE`**: Hides gridlines, which can create a cleaner look in some reports.

```{r}
#| eval: false
addWorksheet(wb, sheetName = "Sales Report", gridLines = TRUE)

```

**`writeData()`**

The `writeData()` function from the **openxlsx** package in R is used to add data to a specific worksheet in an Excel workbook. Here’s what each argument in your code does:

-   **`wb`**: This is the workbook object where you want to write data. The workbook should already be created using `createWorkbook()`.

-   **`sheet = 1`**: This specifies the sheet to which you’re writing data. Here, `1` refers to the first sheet in the workbook. You can also use the sheet's name (e.g., `sheet = "Sales Report"`) if you prefer.

-   **`x = data`**: This is the data you want to write to the worksheet. `data` can be a data frame, matrix, or vector.

-   **`startRow = 1`**: This specifies the row in the worksheet where the data should start. In this case, data will be written beginning at the first row.

-   **`startCol = 1`**: This specifies the column where the data should start. Setting this to `1` will write data starting from the first column (column "A" in Excel).

```{r}
#| eval: false
writeData(wb, sheet = 1, x = data, startRow = 1, startCol = 1)

```

## Step-by-Step Report Creation

Let's create a sample sales report with multiple sheets, formatting, and charts.

### Step 1: Prepare Sample Data

```{r}

# Create sample sales data
set.seed(123)
sales_data <- data.frame(
  Date = seq.Date(as.Date("2023-01-01"), as.Date("2023-12-31"), by = "month"),
  Region = rep(c("North", "South", "East", "West"), 3),
  Sales = round(runif(12, 10000, 50000), 2),
  Units = round(runif(12, 100, 500)),
  Profit = round(runif(12, 5000, 25000), 2)
)

sales_data

```

-   **`set.seed(123)`**: This sets the random seed to ensure that any randomly generated numbers in the code are reproducible. This is useful if you want to get the same "random" values each time you run the code.

-   **`sales_data <- data.frame(...)`**: This creates a data frame called `sales_data` to store the sample sales data. A data frame is a table-like structure in R, suitable for storing datasets.

-   **`Date = seq.Date(...)`**: `seq.Date()` generates a sequence of dates from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, with one date per month.

    -   `as.Date("2023-01-01")` and `as.Date("2023-12-31")` define the start and end dates for the sequence.

    -   `by = "month"` specifies that the sequence should increment by one month at a time, creating 12 monthly date entries.

-   **`Region = rep(c("North", "South", "East", "West"), 3)`**: `rep(c("North", "South", "East", "West"), 3)` repeats the four regions ("North", "South", "East", "West") three times to get a total of 12 values. This column will indicate which region each data entry corresponds to.

-   **`Sales = round(runif(12, 10000, 50000), 2)`**:

    -   `runif(12, 10000, 50000)` generates 12 random numbers between 10,000 and 50,000, representing the monthly sales figures.

    -   `round(..., 2)` rounds these sales figures to two decimal places for readability.

-   **`Units = round(runif(12, 100, 500))`**:

    -   `runif(12, 100, 500)` generates 12 random integers between 100 and 500, representing the number of units sold each month.

    -   `round()` rounds these values to the nearest whole number.

-   **`Profit = round(runif(12, 5000, 25000), 2)`**:

    -   `runif(12, 5000, 25000)` generates 12 random numbers between 5,000 and 25,000, representing monthly profit values.

    -   `round(..., 2)` rounds each profit value to two decimal places.

### Step 2: Create Workbook and Add Sheets

Following code creates an Excel workbook and prepares it with several worksheets and customized styles for titles and headers. Let's walk through each part.

```{r}
# Create new workbook
wb <- createWorkbook()
```

This line initializes a new workbook object (`wb`) where you’ll add worksheets and data. The workbook is created using `createWorkbook()` from the **openxlsx** package.

```{r}
# Add worksheets
addWorksheet(wb, "Summary")
addWorksheet(wb, "Details")
addWorksheet(wb, "Charts")
```

These lines add three worksheets to the workbook, named "Summary," "Details," and "Charts." Each worksheet will be a separate tab in the Excel file.

```{r}
# Create a title style
title_style <- createStyle(
  fontSize = 14,
  fontColour = "#FFFFFF",
  halign = "center",
  fgFill = "#4F81BD",
  textDecoration = "bold",
  border = "TopBottom",
  borderColour = "#4F81BD"
)
```

-   **`createStyle()`**: This function defines a custom style that you can apply to specific cells in the workbook. The style here is designed for titles and is stored in `title_style`.

#### Arguments in `createStyle()` for the Title:

-   **`fontSize = 14`**: Sets the font size to 14 for better visibility of the title.

-   **`fontColour = "#FFFFFF"`**: Sets the font color to white, using a hexadecimal color code.

-   **`halign = "center"`**: Horizontally aligns the text to the center within the cell.

-   **`fgFill = "#4F81BD"`**: Sets the background fill color (foreground color) of the cell to a shade of blue (`#4F81BD`).

-   **`textDecoration = "bold"`**: Makes the text bold to emphasize it as a title.

-   **`border = "TopBottom"`**: Adds borders to the top and bottom of the cell to give the title a framed appearance.

-   **`borderColour = "#4F81BD"`**: Sets the color of the borders to match the blue fill color.

```{r}
# Create header style
header_style <- createStyle(
  fontSize = 12,
  fontColour = "#000000",
  halign = "center",
  fgFill = "#DCE6F1",
  textDecoration = "bold",
  border = "bottom",
  borderColour = "#4F81BD"
)
```

-   This style is designed for headers in the worksheets, stored in `header_style`.

#### Arguments in `createStyle()` for the Header:

-   **`fontSize = 12`**: Sets a slightly smaller font size than the title.

-   **`fontColour = "#000000"`**: Sets the font color to black.

-   **`halign = "center"`**: Centers the text within each cell.

-   **`fgFill = "#DCE6F1"`**: Sets a light blue background fill for the header cells to distinguish them visually.

-   **`textDecoration = "bold"`**: Makes the header text bold.

-   **`border = "bottom"`**: Adds a border to the bottom of the cell.

-   **`borderColour = "#4F81BD"`**: Sets the color of the bottom border to the same blue as in the title style.

### Step 3: Add Summary Data and Formatting

This code adds a formatted title and data summary to the "Summary" worksheet in an Excel workbook, then applies styling to headers and numeric data, and adjusts column widths for a polished appearance. Let’s go through each section.

```{r}

# Write title
writeData(wb, "Summary", "Sales Performance Report 2023", startCol = 1, startRow = 1)
mergeCells(wb, "Summary", cols = 1:5, rows = 1)
addStyle(wb, "Summary", title_style, rows = 1, cols = 1:5)

```

-   **`writeData(wb, "Summary", "Sales Performance Report 2023", startCol = 1, startRow = 1)`**: This places the text `"Sales Performance Report 2023"` in cell A1 of the "Summary" worksheet.

-   **`mergeCells(wb, "Summary", cols = 1:5, rows = 1)`**: Merges cells from columns 1 to 5 (A to E) in the first row, centering the title across these columns to make it look like a unified title.

-   **`addStyle(wb, "Summary", title_style, rows = 1, cols = 1:5)`**: Applies the previously defined `title_style` to the merged title cell. This style includes formatting like font size, color, alignment, and borders, giving the title a professional appearance.

```{r}
# Write data with headers
writeData(wb, "Summary", sales_data, startCol = 1, startRow = 3)
addStyle(wb, "Summary", header_style, rows = 3, cols = 1:5)
```

-   **`writeData(wb, "Summary", sales_data, startCol = 1, startRow = 3)`**: Writes the `sales_data` data frame starting from cell A3. Row 3 will contain the headers from `sales_data`, while the rows below will contain the data.

-   **`addStyle(wb, "Summary", header_style, rows = 3, cols = 1:5)`**: Applies the `header_style` to row 3 (columns A to E) to make the headers bold, centered, and colored with a background fill. This improves readability and distinguishes the headers from the data.

```{r}
# Format numbers
number_style <- createStyle(numFmt = "#,##0.00")
addStyle(wb, "Summary", number_style, rows = 4:15, cols = 3:5, gridExpand = TRUE)
```

-   **`number_style <- createStyle(numFmt = "#,##0.00")`**: Defines a style named `number_style` that formats numbers with commas as thousands separators and two decimal places (e.g., `12,345.67`).

-   **`addStyle(wb, "Summary", number_style, rows = 4:15, cols = 3:5, gridExpand = TRUE)`**:

    -   Applies this `number_style` to columns 3 through 5 (Sales, Units, and Profit columns in `sales_data`) for rows 4 to 15, covering all data rows.

    -   **`gridExpand = TRUE`** ensures the style applies to the entire specified range, not just the first cell in each row or column.

```{r}
# Adjust column widths
setColWidths(wb, "Summary", cols = 1:5, widths = "auto")

```

**`setColWidths(wb, "Summary", cols = 1:5, widths = "auto")`**: Automatically adjusts the widths of columns 1 through 5 (A to E) based on their content. This ensures that all data, headers, and titles are fully visible without manual adjustment.

### Step 4: Create and Add Visualizations

This code creates a line chart to visualize monthly sales trends and inserts it into an Excel workbook. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of each part.

```{r}
# Create monthly sales trend chart
sales_plot <- ggplot(sales_data, aes(x = Date, y = Sales)) +
  geom_line(color = "#4F81BD", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "#4F81BD", size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Monthly Sales Trend",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Sales ($)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"))

# Save plot to workbook
insertPlot(wb, "Charts", width = 8, height = 6,
          startCol = 1, startRow = 1)
```

**`insertPlot()`** is an **openxlsx** function that saves the current plot into a specified worksheet in an Excel workbook.

-   **`wb`**: Specifies the workbook to insert the plot into.

-   **`"Charts"`**: Specifies the worksheet where the plot will be placed.

-   **`width = 8, height = 6`**: Sets the width and height of the plot in inches.

-   **`startCol = 1, startRow = 1`**: Inserts the plot starting at cell A1 of the "Charts" worksheet.

### Step 5: Add Regional Analysis

Then let's create a summary of sales data by region, writes it to the "Details" worksheet in an Excel workbook, and applies styling for a professional presentation.

```{r}

# Create regional summary
regional_summary <- sales_data %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Sales = sum(Sales),
    Avg_Units = mean(Units),
    Total_Profit = sum(Profit)
  )

# Write regional summary to Details sheet
writeData(wb, "Details", "Regional Performance Summary", startCol = 1, startRow = 1)
mergeCells(wb, "Details", cols = 1:4, rows = 1)
addStyle(wb, "Details", title_style, rows = 1, cols = 1:4)

writeData(wb, "Details", regional_summary, startCol = 1, startRow = 3)
addStyle(wb, "Details", header_style, rows = 3, cols = 1:4)

```

### Step 6: Save the Workbook

Lastly with this command finalizes and exports the workbook, preserving all worksheets, data, formatting, and charts created in previous steps. You should see a file named `Sales_Report_2023.xlsx` in your working directory after this line runs.

```{r}
# Save the workbook
saveWorkbook(wb, "Sales_Report_2023.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

After saving the Excel file with the `Summary`, `Details`, and `Charts` sheets, I opened the file to review the output. Below, I’m sharing screenshots of each sheet to showcase the final report layout, formatting, and visualization.

In the **Summary** sheet, you can see the main title, followed by a detailed table with the monthly sales data. The headers and values are formatted to improve readability and create a professional appearance.

![](Summary.png){fig-align="center"}

The **Details** sheet provides a regional breakdown with aggregated sales, average units, and profit for each region. This sheet includes formatted headers and a clear, centered title, making it easy to interpret the regional performance metrics.

![](Details.png){fig-align="center"}

Lastly, the **Charts** sheet contains a line graph displaying the monthly sales trend. This visualization is useful for spotting sales patterns and seeing how performance changes over the months.
