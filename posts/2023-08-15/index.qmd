Hello everyone! For my first post on my blog, I would like to make an introduction about R. Before we start coding with R, it's not a bad idea to know a little about this program and learn what we can do. I will try to answer questions such as why do we need R, how can I install R on my computer, what are the useful resources about R. So, let's get started.

## What is R?

R is an open source integrated software environment that combines data manipulation, programming and graphical representation, as well as many features such as statistical and econometric calculations.

R is derived from the previously developed programming language S.

It was developed by Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman and announced in 1993.
