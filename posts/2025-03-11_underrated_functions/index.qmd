R is packed with powerhouse tools—think dplyr for data wrangling, ggplot2 for stunning visuals, or tidyr for tidying up messes. But beyond the headliners, there’s a lineup of lesser-known functions that deserve a spot in your toolkit. These hidden gems can streamline your code, solve tricky problems, and even make you wonder how you managed without them. In this post, we’ll uncover four underrated R functions: **`Reduce, vapply, do.call`** and **`janitor::clean_names`**. With practical examples ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced, plus outputs to show you what’s possible, this guide will have you itching to try them out in your next project. Let’s dive in and see what these under-the-radar stars can do!

## 1. Reduce: Collapse with Control

### What It Does and Its Arguments

Reduce is a base R function that iteratively applies a two-argument function to a list or vector, shrinking it down to a single result. It’s like a secret weapon for avoiding loops while keeping things elegant.

**Key Arguments:**

-   `f:` The function to apply (e.g., +, \*, or a custom one).

-   `x:` The list or vector to reduce.

-   `init` (optional): A starting value (defaults to the first element of x if omitted).

-   `accumulate` (optional): If TRUE, returns all intermediate results (defaults to FALSE).

### Use Cases

-   Summing or multiplying without explicit iteration.

-   Combining data structures step-by-step.

-   Simplifying recursive tasks.

### Examples

#### Simple: Quick Sum

```{r}
numbers <- 1:5
total <- Reduce(`+`, numbers)
print(total)
```

***Explanation**:* Reduce adds 1 + 2 = 3, then 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 4 = 10, and 10 + 5 = 15. It’s a sleek alternative to sum().

#### Intermediate: String Building

```{r}
words <- c("R", "is", "awesome")
sentence <- Reduce(paste, words, init = "")
print(sentence)
```

***Explanation**:* Starting with an empty string (init = ""), Reduce glues the words together with spaces. Skip init, and it starts with "R", which might not be what you want.

#### Advanced: Merging Data Frames

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = c("x", "y"))
df2 <- data.frame(a = 3:4, b = c("z", "w"))
df3 <- data.frame(a = 5:6, b = c("p", "q"))
combined <- Reduce(rbind, list(df1, df2, df3))
print(combined)
```

***Explanation**:* Reduce stacks three data frames row-wise, pairing them up one by one. It’s a loop-free way to handle multiple merges.

## A Quick Note on purrr::reduce()

If you’re a fan of the tidyverse, check out purrr::reduce(). It’s a modern take on base R’s Reduce, offering a consistent syntax with other purrr functions (like .x and .y for arguments) and handy shortcuts like \~ .x + .y for inline functions. It also defaults to left-to-right reduction but can go right-to-left with reduce_right(). Worth a look if you want a more polished, tidyverse-friendly alternative!

Here's an intermediate-level example of using the `reduce()` function from the `purrr` package for joining multiple dataframes:

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(purrr)
library(dplyr)

# Create three sample dataframes representing different aspects of customer data
customers <- data.frame(
  customer_id = 1:5,
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Edward"),
  age = c(32, 45, 28, 36, 52)
)

orders <- data.frame(
  order_id = 101:108,
  customer_id = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5),
  order_date = as.Date(c("2023-01-15", "2023-01-20", "2023-02-10", 
                        "2023-01-05", "2023-02-15", "2023-03-20",
                        "2023-02-25", "2023-03-10")),
  amount = c(120.50, 85.75, 200.00, 45.99, 75.25, 150.00, 95.50, 210.25)
)

feedback <- data.frame(
  feedback_id = 201:206,
  customer_id = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5),
  rating = c(4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4),
  feedback_date = as.Date(c("2023-01-20", "2023-01-25", "2023-01-10",
                          "2023-02-20", "2023-03-01", "2023-03-15"))
)

# List of dataframes to join with the joining column
dataframes_to_join <- list(
  list(df = customers, by = "customer_id"),
  list(df = orders, by = "customer_id"),
  list(df = feedback, by = "customer_id")
)

# Using reduce to join all dataframes
# Start with customers dataframe and progressively join the others
joined_data <- reduce(
  dataframes_to_join[-1],  # Exclude first dataframe as it's our starting point
  function(acc, x) {
    left_join(acc, x$df, by = x$by)
  },
  .init = dataframes_to_join[[1]]$df  # Start with customers dataframe
)

# View the result
print(joined_data)

```

This example demonstrates how to use `reduce()` to join multiple dataframes in a sequential, elegant way. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex data integration tasks where you need to combine multiple data sources with a common identifier.

## 2. vapply: Iteration with Assurance

### What It Does and Its Arguments

vapply is another base R gem, similar to lapply but with a twist: it forces you to specify the output type and length upfront. This makes it safer and more predictable, especially for critical tasks.

**Key Arguments:**

-   `X`: The list or vector to process.

-   `FUN`: The function to apply to each element.

-   `FUN.VALUE`: A template for the output (e.g., numeric(1) for a single number).

### Use Cases

-   Guaranteeing consistent output types.

-   Extracting specific stats from lists.

-   Writing reliable code for packages or production.

### Examples

#### Simple: Doubling Up

```{r}
values <- 1:3
doubled <- vapply(values, function(x) x * 2, numeric(1))
print(doubled)
```

***Explanation**:* Each value doubles, and numeric(1) ensures a numeric vector—simple and rock-solid.

#### Intermediate: Word Lengths

```{r}
terms <- c("data", "science", "R")
lengths <- vapply(terms, nchar, numeric(1))
print(lengths)
```

***Explanation**:* vapply counts characters per word, delivering a numeric vector every time—no surprises like sapply might throw.

#### Advanced: Stats Snapshot

```{r}
samples <- list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5), c(6, 7, 8))
stats <- vapply(samples, function(x) c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)), numeric(2))
print(stats)
```

***Explanation**:* For each sample, vapply computes mean and standard deviation, returning a matrix (2 rows, 3 columns). It’s a tidy, type-safe summary.

## 3. do.call: Dynamic Function Magic

### What It Does and Its Arguments

do.call in base R lets you call a function with a list of arguments, making it a go-to for flexible, on-the-fly operations. It’s like having a universal remote for your functions.

**Key Arguments:**

-   `what`: The function to call (e.g., rbind, paste).

-   `args`: A list of arguments to pass.

-   `quote` (optional): Rarely used, defaults to FALSE.

### Use Cases

-   Combining variable inputs.

-   Running functions dynamically.

-   Simplifying calls with list-based data.

### Examples

#### Simple: Vector Mashup

```{r}
chunks <- list(1:3, 4:6)
all <- do.call(c, chunks)
print(all)
```

***Explanation**:* do.call feeds the list to c(), stitching the vectors together effortlessly.

#### Intermediate: Custom Join

```{r}
bits <- list("Code", "Runs", "Fast")
joined <- do.call(paste, c(bits, list(sep = "|")))
print(joined)
```

***Explanation**:* do.call combines the list with a sep argument, creating a piped string in one smooth move.

#### Advanced: Flexible Binding

```{r}
df_list <- list(data.frame(x = 1:2), data.frame(x = 3:4))
direction <- "vertical"
bound <- do.call(if (direction == "vertical") rbind else cbind, df_list)
print(bound)
```

***Explanation**:* With direction = "vertical", do.call uses rbind to stack rows. Change it to "horizontal", and cbind takes over—dynamic and smart.

## 4. janitor::clean_names: Tame Your Column Chaos

### What It Does and Its Arguments

From the janitor package, clean_names() transforms messy column names into consistent, code-friendly formats (e.g., lowercase with underscores). It’s a time-saver you’ll wish you’d known sooner.

**Key Arguments:**

-   `dat`: The data frame to clean.

-   `case`: The style for names (e.g., "snake", "small_camel", defaults to "snake").

-   `replace`: A named vector for custom replacements (optional).

### Use Cases

-   Standardizing imported data with ugly headers.

-   Prepping data frames for analysis or plotting.

-   Avoiding frustration with inconsistent naming.

### Examples

#### Simple: Basic Cleanup

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(janitor)

# Create a dataframe with messy column names
df <- data.frame(
  `First Name` = c("John", "Mary", "David"),
  `Last.Name` = c("Smith", "Johnson", "Williams"),
  `Email-Address` = c("john@example.com", "mary@example.com", "david@example.com"),
  `Annual Income ($)` = c(65000, 78000, 52000),
  check.names = FALSE
)

# View original column names
names(df)

# Clean the names
clean_df <- clean_names(df)

# View cleaned column names
names(clean_df)

```

What `clean_names()` specifically does:

-   Converts all names to lowercase

-   Replaces spaces with underscores

-   Removes special characters like periods and hyphens

-   Creates names that are valid R variable names and follow standard naming conventions

This standardization makes your data more consistent, easier to work with, and helps prevent errors when manipulating or joining datasets.

#### Intermediate: Custom Style

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

# Create multiple dataframes with inconsistent naming
df1 <- data.frame(
  `Customer ID` = 1:3,
  `First Name` = c("John", "Mary", "David"),
  `LAST NAME` = c("Smith", "Johnson", "Williams"),
  check.names = FALSE
)

df2 <- data.frame(
  `customer.id` = 4:6,
  `firstName` = c("Michael", "Linda", "James"),
  `lastName` = c("Brown", "Davis", "Miller"),
  check.names = FALSE
)

df3 <- data.frame(
  `cust_id` = 7:9,
  `first-name` = c("Robert", "Jennifer", "Thomas"),
  `last-name` = c("Wilson", "Martinez", "Anderson"),
  check.names = FALSE
)

# List of dataframes
dfs <- list(df1, df2, df3)

# Clean names of all dataframes
clean_dfs <- map(dfs, clean_names)

# Print column names for each cleaned dataframe
map(clean_dfs, names)

# Bind the dataframes (now possible because of standardized column names)
combined_df <- bind_rows(clean_dfs)
print(combined_df)

```

This code demonstrates a more advanced use case of the `clean_names()` function when working with multiple data frames that have inconsistent naming conventions. Note that because of the different column names for customer ID, we have missing values in the combined dataframe. This example demonstrates why standardized naming is important.

#### Advanced: Targeted Fixes

```{r}
df <- data.frame("ID#" = 1:2, "Sales_%" = c(10, 20), "Q1 Revenue" = c(100, 200))
cleaned <- clean_names(df, replace = c("#" = "_num", "%" = "_pct"))
print(names(cleaned))
```

***Explanation**:* Custom replace swaps \# for \_num and % for \_pct, while clean_names handles the rest—precision meets polish.

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(readxl)


# Create a temporary Excel file with problematic column names
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
df <- data.frame(
  `ID#` = 1:5,
  `%_Completed` = c(85, 92, 78, 100, 65),
  `Result (Pass/Fail)` = c("Pass", "Pass", "Fail", "Pass", "Fail"),
  `μg/mL` = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.3, 1.2, 0.4),
  `p-value` = c(0.03, 0.01, 0.08, 0.002, 0.06),
  check.names = FALSE
)

# Save as Excel (simulating real-world data source)
if (require(writexl)) {
  write_xlsx(df, temp_file)
} else {
  # Fall back to CSV if writexl not available
  write.csv(df, sub("\\.xlsx$", ".csv", temp_file), row.names = FALSE)
  temp_file <- sub("\\.xlsx$", ".csv", temp_file)
}

# Read the file back
if (temp_file == sub("\\.xlsx$", ".csv", temp_file)) {
  imported_df <- read.csv(temp_file, check.names = FALSE)
} else {
  imported_df <- read_excel(temp_file)
}

# View original column names
print(names(imported_df))

# Create custom replacements
custom_replacements <- c(
  "μg" = "ug",  # Replace Greek letter
  "%" = "percent",  # Replace percent symbol
  "#" = "num"   # Replace hash
)

# Clean with custom replacements
clean_df <- imported_df %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename_with(~ stringr::str_replace_all(., "p_value", "probability"))

# View cleaned column names
print(names(clean_df))

# Print the cleaned dataframe
print(clean_df)

```

The final output shows the transformation from problematic column names to standardized ones:

From:

-   `ID#`

-   `%_Completed`

-   `Result (Pass/Fail)`

-   `μg/mL`

-   `p-value`

To:

-   `id_num`

-   `percent_completed`

-   `result_pass_fail`

-   `ug_m_l`

-   `probability`

This example demonstrates how `clean_names()` can be part of a more sophisticated data preparation workflow, especially when working with real-world data sources that contain problematic characters and naming conventions.
