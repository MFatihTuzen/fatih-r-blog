Should you?**\\\n> You proudly present a model with R² = 0.95. Everyone applauds.\\\n> But what if your model fails miserably on the next new data?\n\nWhen building a statistical model, one of the first numbers analysts and data scientists often cite is the **R²**, or coefficient of determination. It's widely reported in research, academic theses, and industry reports — and yet, frequently misunderstood or misused.\n\nDoes a high R² mean your model is good? Is it enough to evaluate model performance? What about its adjusted or predictive counterparts?\n\nThis article will explore in depth: - What R², Adjusted R², and Predicted R² actually mean - Why relying solely on R² can mislead you - How to evaluate models using **both explanatory and predictive power** - Real-life implementation using the **{tidymodels}** framework in R\n\nWe’ll also discuss best practices and common pitfalls, and equip you with a mindset to look beyond surface-level model summaries.\n\n# Theoretical Background\n\n## What is R²?\n\nThe **coefficient of determination**, R², is defined as:\n\n$$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SS}_{\\text{res}}}{\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}}$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $\\text{SS}_{\\text{res}}$ = Sum of squares of residuals = $\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$\n\n-   $\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}$ = Total sum of squares = $\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$\n\nIt tells us the **proportion of variance explained by the model**. An R² of 0.80 implies that 80% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the model.\n\nBut beware — it only measures **fit to training data**, not the model's ability to **generalize**.\n\n## Adjusted R²\n\nWhen we add predictors to a regression model, R² will never decrease — even if the added variables are irrelevant.\n\n**Adjusted R²** corrects this by penalizing the number of predictors: $$R^2_{\\text{adj}} = 1 - \\left(1 - R^2\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1}\\right)$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   n : number of observations\n\n-   p : number of predictors\n\nThus, Adjusted R² will **only increase** if the new predictor improves the model more than expected by chance.\n\n## Predicted R²\n\n**Predicted R²** (or cross-validated R²) is the most honest estimate of model utility. It answers the question:\n\n> *How well will this model predict new, unseen data?*\n\nThis is typically calculated using cross-validation, and unlike regular R², it reflects **out-of-sample performance**.\n\nYou can also view it as:\n\n$$R^2_{\\text{pred}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{PRESS}}{\\text{SS}_{\\text{tot}}}$$\n\nWhere PRESS is the **Prediction Error Sum of Squares** based on cross-validation.\n\n# Dataset Overview\n\nWe’ll use the classic **Boston Housing Dataset** to demonstrate. It includes:\n\n-   Socio-economic and housing variables for 506 Boston suburbs\n\n-   Target: `medv` (median value of owner-occupied homes in \\$1000s)\n\nBelow are the key variables:\n\n-   **crim**: per capita crime rate by town\n-   **zn**: proportion of residential land zoned for large lots\n-   **indus**: proportion of non-retail business acres\n-   **chas**: Charles River dummy variable (1 = tract bounds river; 0 = otherwise)\n-   **nox**: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n-   **rm**: average number of rooms per dwelling\n-   **age**: proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940\n-   **dis**: weighted distance to employment centers\n-   **rad**: index of accessibility to radial highways\n-   **tax**: property-tax rate per \\$10,000\n-   **ptratio**: pupil-teacher ratio by town\n-   **black**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)\\^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents\n-   **lstat**: percentage of lower status of the population\n-   **medv**: **target** — median value of owner-occupied homes (in \\$1000s)\n\nThis regression problem mimics common real estate or socio-economic modeling use cases. Let’s first examine the dataset’s summary statistics.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(corrr)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nboston <- MASS::Boston\nskim(boston)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\nTable: Data summary\n\n|                         |       |\n|:------------------------|:------|\n|Name                     |boston |\n|Number of rows           |506    |\n|Number of columns        |14     |\n|_______________________  |       |\n|Column type frequency:   |       |\n|numeric                  |14     |\n|________________________ |       |\n|Group variables          |None   |\n\n\n**Variable type: numeric**\n\n|skim_variable | n_missing| complete_rate|   mean|     sd|     p0|    p25|    p50|    p75|   p100|hist  |\n|:-------------|---------:|-------------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|:-----|\n|crim          |         0|             1|   3.61|   8.60|   0.01|   0.08|   0.26|   3.68|  88.98|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|zn            |         0|             1|  11.36|  23.32|   0.00|   0.00|   0.00|  12.50| 100.00|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|indus         |         0|             1|  11.14|   6.86|   0.46|   5.19|   9.69|  18.10|  27.74|▇▆▁▇▁ |\n|chas          |         0|             1|   0.07|   0.25|   0.00|   0.00|   0.00|   0.00|   1.00|▇▁▁▁▁ |\n|nox           |         0|             1|   0.55|   0.12|   0.38|   0.45|   0.54|   0.62|   0.87|▇▇▆▅▁ |\n|rm            |         0|             1|   6.28|   0.70|   3.56|   5.89|   6.21|   6.62|   8.78|▁▂▇▂▁ |\n|age           |         0|             1|  68.57|  28.15|   2.90|  45.02|  77.50|  94.07| 100.00|▂▂▂▃▇ |\n|dis           |         0|             1|   3.80|   2.11|   1.13|   2.10|   3.21|   5.19|  12.13|▇▅▂▁▁ |\n|rad           |         0|             1|   9.55|   8.71|   1.00|   4.00|   5.00|  24.00|  24.00|▇▂▁▁▃ |\n|tax           |         0|             1| 408.24| 168.54| 187.00| 279.00| 330.00| 666.00| 711.00|▇▇▃▁▇ |\n|ptratio       |         0|             1|  18.46|   2.16|  12.60|  17.40|  19.05|  20.20|  22.00|▁▃▅▅▇ |\n|black         |         0|             1| 356.67|  91.29|   0.32| 375.38| 391.44| 396.22| 396.90|▁▁▁▁▇ |\n|lstat         |         0|             1|  12.65|   7.14|   1.73|   6.95|  11.36|  16.96|  37.97|▇▇▅▂▁ |\n|medv          |         0|             1|  22.53|   9.20|   5.00|  17.02|  21.20|  25.00|  50.00|▂▇▅▁▁ |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Commentary:**\n\n-   Variables like `crim`, `tax`, and `lstat` exhibit high variability and potential skewness.\n\n-   `chas` is binary and acts like a categorical indicator.\n\n-   The target variable `medv` ranges from \\$5,000 to \\$50,000 (capped).\n\n-   `rm` (average number of rooms) and `lstat` (lower status population) show notable spread and will likely play strong roles in the model.\n\nNext, we examine correlations with `medv`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboston %>% correlate() %>% corrr::focus(medv) %>% arrange(desc(medv))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   term      medv\n   <chr>    <dbl>\n 1 rm       0.695\n 2 zn       0.360\n 3 black    0.333\n 4 dis      0.250\n 5 chas     0.175\n 6 age     -0.377\n 7 rad     -0.382\n 8 crim    -0.388\n 9 nox     -0.427\n10 tax     -0.469\n11 indus   -0.484\n12 ptratio -0.508\n13 lstat   -0.738\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Interpretation of Correlations:**\n\n-   `rm` shows a **strong positive** correlation with `medv` — more rooms generally imply higher value.\n\n-   `lstat` and `crim` have **strong negative** correlations — as lower status or crime increases, housing values drop.\n\n-   `nox`, `age`, and `ptratio` also show negative correlations with price, hinting at socio-environmental effects.\n\nThese insights will guide us in building and evaluating our model.\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nLet’s visualize some of the most influential variables in relation to `medv`, our target variable.

Here, we’ll go beyond textbook definitions and highlight real-world traps and misunderstandings related to R² and its variants.\n\n**🚫 Misconception 1: High R² means the model is good**\n\n-   A model with R² = 0.95 may **look impressive**, but that doesn’t guarantee predictive power.\n-   High R² can result from overfitting, especially when the model is complex or contains many predictors.\n-   **Adjusted R² and Predicted R²** must be considered to evaluate true usefulness.\n\n**⚠️ Misconception 2: Adding predictors always improves the model**\n\n-   While R² never decreases with more variables, **Adjusted R² can** — and should — if the new variable doesn’t add real value.\n-   Including irrelevant predictors increases complexity without improving explanatory power.\n-   This is a form of **dimensional overfitting**.\n\n**❌ Misconception 3: R² indicates causality**\n\n-   R² quantifies correlation, **not causation**.\n-   A high R² can arise from spurious relationships or confounding variables.\n-   Always supplement with **domain knowledge** and causal reasoning.\n\n**📉 Misconception 4: R² is a universal performance metric**\n\n-   R² only applies to **regression tasks**. Using it for classification models is inappropriate and meaningless.\n-   For binary classification, use metrics like **AUC**, **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.\n\n**🔍 Misconception 5: Residual plots don’t matter if R² is high**\n\n-   A good R² doesn’t guarantee that model assumptions are met.\n-   Residual patterns may still reveal **non-linearity**, **heteroskedasticity**, or **influential outliers**.\n-   Always inspect residual diagnostics.\n\n**💡 Misconception 6: Predicted R² isn’t necessary**\n\n-   Many practitioners report R² and Adjusted R², but **omit cross-validation entirely**.\n-   **Predicted R²** (e.g., via 10-fold CV) is the **most honest measure** of model generalizability.\n\n**🔬 Misconception 7: R² has a fixed interpretation**\n\n-   R² values **depend on the context**. In social sciences, an R² of 0.3 can be meaningful, while in physics we expect 0.99+.\n-   A \"low\" R² doesn’t mean the model is useless — it may reflect inherent variability in human behavior or macroeconomic data.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> **Insight:** Always use R² in context — alongside other metrics, validation strategies, and graphical checks.\n\nFor a deeper dive into R² misconceptions and proper regression diagnostics, see:\n\n-   Harrell, F. (2015). *Regression Modeling Strategies*.

(2004). *Applied Linear Regression Models*.\n\nTogether, these references build the foundation for **responsible model interpretation**.\n\n# Conclusion & Recommendations\n\n## 📌 Summary\n\nIn this post, we explored **R²**, **Adjusted R²**, and **Predicted R²** in depth — not just as mathematical constructs, but as tools for critical thinking in modeling. We walked through theory, practical application in R with tidymodels, residual diagnostics, and even model improvement through transformation.\n\nLet’s recap: - **R²** tells us how well our model fits the training data, but can be misleading on its own. - **Adjusted R²** improves upon R² by accounting for model complexity. - **Predicted R²**, evaluated via cross-validation, provides the most trustworthy estimate of real-world performance.\n\nHigh R² values can be seductive. But as we saw, **they don't guarantee causality, generalizability, or correctness**. Only by combining R² with residual diagnostics, domain knowledge, and out-of-sample validation can we judge a model responsibly.\n\n## 💡 Recommendations for Practitioners\n\n1.  **Always accompany R² with Adjusted and Predicted R²** — never rely on one metric alone.\n2.  **Perform residual diagnostics** to check linearity, variance assumptions, and outlier influence.\n3.  **Use cross-validation (e.g., 10-fold)** as a default evaluation strategy, especially when the dataset is not large.\n4.  **Transform nonlinear predictors** (as we did with `lstat`) or use flexible models (e.g., splines, GAMs) when needed.\n5.  **Avoid including irrelevant predictors** — they inflate R² without improving generalization.\n6.  **Contextualize your R²** — in some fields, a lower R² is still useful; in others, it may signal inadequacy.\n7.  **Complement numerical metrics with visual tools** — scatterplots, predicted vs. actual plots, and residuals reveal insights numbers alone may miss.\n\n## 🚀 Looking Ahead\n\nIf you want to take your modeling further: - Try **ridge or lasso regression** to handle multicollinearity. - Explore **tree-based models** (e.g., random forests) when relationships are complex and nonlinear. - Use tools like **`yardstick`** and **`modeltime`** to automate robust validation and reporting.\n\n> In the end, modeling isn’t just about maximizing R² — it’s about **understanding your data, validating your decisions**, and making **informed predictions**.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nFeel free to share, fork, or reuse this analysis.
